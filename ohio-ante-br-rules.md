# Ohio Ante - Club Cards
- Ebon Mox, or other Ebon created cards are allowed. If running an Ebon Mox, you can’t also run a Mox Jet.  It is one or the other. 
- Roc Lotus and other Roc Cards ARE permitted in addition to their original printings. 

# Specially Legal Cards
- Enemy Pain Lands are specially legal (Shivan reef, Caves of koilos etc)
- Harper Prism Book Promos: Mana Crypt, Windseeker Centaur, Giant Badger, Arena, Sewers of Estark, and Nalathni Dragon.

# Additional Sets and Cards Allowed (ie. REPRINTS)
- Ohio Ante allow all non-foil cards from the sets above, that were reprinted IN ANY LANGUAGE with the original frame and original art. So for example, a Chronicles City of Brass, Fifth Edition Wrath of God, Time Spiral Psionic Blast, and Collector’s Edition Mox Ruby would all be legal (original frame + original art), while an Arena 1996 Counterspell would not be legal (different art). The misprinted Revised Serendib Efreet (with Ifh-Biff Efreet’s art, and green border) is of course allowed, because it was printed in one of the original sets in 1994 (Revised).
- Absolutely no proxies and fake cards allowed, official Club cards excepted.

# Deck Construction
Constructed decks must contain a minimum of 60 cards (no maximum deck size; however, you must be able to shuffle your deck with no assistance). With the exception of basic land cards (Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, Forest), a player’s deck may not contain more than 4 of any individual card, counted by its English card title equivalent.

# Ante Sideboard
Per event, you can have 10 cards on the side to replace lost cards. These cards can be extra copies of 4x cards in your deck, but your deck must remain legally constructed throughout the event.
